[Verse 1]
Don't think I've been this nervous with a cold drink
In my two hands, saying no thanks
Like any way it goes cause I know things
They shouldn't have told me
Now I'm thinking what for
Hanging by a sentence at the dr*g store
Barely even steady out the front door
Hate my own sh*t, but I love yours
F*ck I really love yours
