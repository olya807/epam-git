[Verse 1]
Don't think I've been this nervous with a cold drink
In my two hands, saying no thanks
Like any way it goes cause I know things
They shouldn't have told me
Now I'm thinking what for
Hanging by a sentence at the dr*g store
Barely even steady out the front door
Hate my own sh*t, but I love yours
F*ck I really love yours

[Hook]
7 in the afternoon, half asleep, count the cars
All I think about is you constantly, that's the hard part
Static on the line, I hear it all the time
But I'm quiet when you make me fade
Feel it coming back, watch it turn to black
But I'm brighter when you make me fade
You make me fade, you make me fade
You make me brighter when you make me fade
